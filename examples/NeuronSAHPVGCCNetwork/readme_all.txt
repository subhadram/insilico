Code for normal simulations is in /home/subhadra/insilico-0.25/examples/NeuronSAHPVGCCNetwork
To run simulations on the machine for a parameter sweep, the code in is /home/subhadra/simulations
Analysed data files are in /home/subhadra/simulations
All the files needed to generate panels are in /home/subhadra/paper2017/panels
Everything on the machine (except the data on 1 TB storage) is backed up on the samba/neuro
1 TB storage data can be found at /media/subhadra/b8f700e2-a56b-4e3c-ba5d-d4a7ab6f5d56/centos6.3/arun/Subhadra/
Cluster code is backed up at samba
CLuster data is backed up at samba (please let me know if you need any specific data set, I will let you know where to find it)
